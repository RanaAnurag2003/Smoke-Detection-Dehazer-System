# Smoke-Detection-Dehazer-System
**Smoke Detection System:**
A smoke detection system utilizes advanced sensors to continuously monitor air quality and promptly detect the presence of smoke particles. These sensors are equipped with algorithms that analyze the collected data in real-time, enabling the system to distinguish between normal atmospheric conditions and potentially hazardous situations caused by smoke or fire. When smoke is detected, the system triggers immediate alerts or alarms, alerting occupants and authorities to the presence of a potential fire hazard. This early detection capability is crucial for mitigating fire risks, allowing for swift intervention and evacuation measures to protect lives and property. Smoke detection systems are integral to building safety protocols in residential, commercial, and industrial settings, providing reliable monitoring and response mechanisms to ensure proactive fire safety management.

**Dehazer System:**
A dehazer system employs sophisticated image processing techniques to enhance visibility in images or video footage affected by haze or fog. By utilizing algorithms such as contrast enhancement, haze removal, or machine learning-based approaches, the system effectively clarifies visuals, making them more suitable for various applications including surveillance, navigation, and photography in challenging weather conditions. These systems analyze the input imagery to identify and reduce haze, thereby improving the overall quality and usability of the visual data. Dehazing technology is essential for enhancing situational awareness in outdoor environments, enabling clearer monitoring and decision-making processes across sectors such as transportation, security, and environmental monitoring.
